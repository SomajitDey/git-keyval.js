# üíÅ git-keyval
A lightweight, portable, modern JavaScript (ESM) SDK to transform your GitHub repository into a global Key-Value DataBase (CRUD), JSON bin and files store with powerful features like optional encryption, expiry and CDN üí™

üöÄ Uses your GitHub repository as a global key-value database, supporting multi-region CRUD (`create`-`read`-`update`-`delete`) operations üåê

üöÄ All writes are atomic! Allows concurrent writes alongwith overwrite protection.

üöÄ Keys and values can be any of multiple JavaScript types -- `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `null`, `Object`, `Array`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`. Future versions may support more datatypes.

üöÄ Optional encryption with user-defined `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods on top of separate access-control managed by GitHub üîê

üöÄ For public repositories, data is cached and served by multiple CDNs enabling lightning-fast reads across the globe, even at places where GitHub is not accessible ‚ö°

üöÄ Database may be repurposed as JSON bin or files store, by storing JSON and file blobs against string-typed keys, respectively. For unencrypted, public repositories, the `create` and `update` operations provide CDN links to download the stored JSON or file with the proper `Content-Type` header üìÅ

üöÄ Allows setting custom expiry for your keys. TTL is counted in days 

üöÄ Uses in-memory LRU cache for performance, also minimizing rate-limited requests to GitHub APIs.

üöÄ Designed not to abuse GitHub or the public CDNs. Data is reused as much as possible with deleted data available for `git gc` at GitHub's end ‚ôªÔ∏è

üöÄ Uses GitHub Actions/CI for automated tasks such as periodic removal of expired/stale keys.

üöÄ Can be implemented with standard Git commands only; does not depend heavily on anything exclusive to GitHub.

üöÄ Loosely coupled to GitHub's API (REST and GraphQL). Can be used with other Git-servers, like GitLab, Bit-bucket or self-hosted, by replacing a single module in this codebase.

üöÄ SDK supports specifying a custom `fetch` method. Using this, custom hooks may be implemented üí°

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under heavy development, and therefore, should be treated as incomplete and unstable. **However, I hope to release an alpha-version pretty soon ü§û**. If it piqued your interest, I request you to [watch this repository](https://github.com/SomajitDey/git-keyval.js "Hit the Watch button of this repository, if you're logged in GitHub") and ‚≠ê it to encourage me.

## Setup GitHub repository
Simply create a GitHub repository from the template available at https://github.com/SomajitDey/git-keyval.js. The newly created repository should be setup automatically. You may check on the setup progress at the `Actions` tab in the homepage of your repository.

## JS SDK usage
Use the JavaScript SDK to access and interact with your newly setup GitHub repository.

### Install and import
For browsers:
```html
<script type="module">
    import DB from 'https://unpkg.com/git-keyval@latest/dist/index.min.js';
    // Replace 'latest' above with the desired version, if not using the latest version
    
    // Your code here ...
</script>
```

For Node.js:

Install as
```bash
npm install git-keyval
```

Import as
```javascript
import DB from 'git-keyval';
```
